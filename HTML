     It has a rich history and cultural heritage, with significant contributions to art, literature, science, and philosophy.
      India is also known for its diverse and vibrant traditions, including music, dance, and festivals.
       Additionally, India has made significant advancements in technology, space exploration, and medicine. 
       The country's natural beauty and biodiversity also contribute to its greatness.</p>

<!-- India Before Independent-->
<div id="Before and After">
<h2>India Before Independent</h2>
<p>As we all know that we got independence in 1947, after long sacrifices.
   These English guys not only tortured us mentally, but also physically.
   They used us as slaves and enjoyed their life to the fullest.
    whether we faced famine or earthquake, they never thought about us. 
   And at the point of independence, they were forced to do so because they lost at the war and it was difficult for them to control us, so they decided to deliver the power to us.
   And to make this process hassle-free, they used their most deserving candidate was called Mountbatten.
    He smartly divided the two nations and then drawn the boundary, without thinking about those whose families rely upon another state.
   As they left us, we weren’t stable enough to handle everything, so we tried everything just as they went.
  But still today, the remains of their hatred remain in society. We are still divided upon religion. 
   Rabindranath Tagore in his poem “Where the mind is without fear” had compared that if the world is broken into narrow fragments of religion, then this world will never be able to unite and can become as heaven.
   If we will try to change our mindset from today, then I am sure that visons of our ancestors will come true. 
   At last, I would like to quote few lines from famous speech ” Tryst with Destiny” :

  The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye.
   That may be beyond us, but so long as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over. 
   And so we have to labor and to work, and work hard, to give reality to our dreams.
    Those dreams are for India, but they are also for the world.</p>
